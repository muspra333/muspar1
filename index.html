      </p><br>
      <p><h2>Early life and background</h2></p>
      <p>
       Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family <br>to parents from Uttarakhand.
      [25][26] He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.[27][28][29][10]<br> His paternal village
      Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand.[30] His parents<br> moved from
      Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position<br>
      in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.[31] Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their <br>
      surname "Dhauni".[30]<br>
      </p>
      <p>From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway
      station under South Eastern Railway <br>in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.[34][35]<br>
      </p>
      <h2>Early career</h2>
      <h3>Junior cricket in Bihar</h3>
      <p>In 1998, Dhoni was selected by Deval Sahay, a former Bihar Cricket Association Vice <br>President 
      and Ranchi District Cricket President, to play for the Central Coal Fields Limited<br> (CCL) team.[36]
      Till 1998 Dhoni, who was in 12th grade, had never played professional cricket. At CCL, he got an<br>
      opportunity to bat higher up the order, where he performed exceptionally, which had <br>helped CCL
      move to the A division.[37] Deval Sahay, impressed by his performance, pushed for his<br> selection
      in the Bihar team.[38] Dhoni moved to the Ranchi team, the junior Bihar cricket team <br>and eventually
      the senior Bihar Ranji Team within one year.[39][40]</p><br>
      <h3>Bihar cricket team</h3>      
      <p>Further information: 2001–02 Ranji Trophy</p>
      <p>Dhoni made his Ranji Trophy debut for Bihar in the 1999–2000 season, <br>as an eighteen-year-old.
      He made a half century in his debut match scoring 68* in the second innings<br> against Assam cricket 
      team.[48] Dhoni finished the season with 283 runs in 5 matches. Dhoni scored his<br> maiden first-class
      century while playing for Bihar against Bengal in the 2000/01 season.[49] Apart from<br> this century,
      his performance in the 2000/01 season[50] did not include another score over fifty <br>and in 
      the 2001/02 season, he scored just five fifties in four Ranji matches.[51]</p><br>
      <h3>Jharkhand cricket team</h3>
       <p>Dhoni's performance in the 2002–03 season included three half-centuries in the<br> Ranji Trophy 
      and a couple of half-centuries in the Deodhar Trophy, as he started gaining recognition<br> for his
      lower-order contribution as well as hard-hitting batting style. In the 2003/04 season,<br>
      Dhoni scored a century (128*) against Assam in the first match of the Ranji ODI tournament.<br>
      Dhoni was part of the East Zone squad that won the Deodhar Trophy 2003–2004 season[52][53]<br>
      and contributed with 244 runs in 4 matches,[54] including a century<br>
      (114) against Central zone.[55]</p><br>
      <h2>2007 World Cup</h2>
      <p>Preparations for the 2007 Cricket World Cup improved as India recorded<br> identical
      3–1 victories over West Indies and Sri Lanka and Dhoni had averages in excess<br> of 
      100 in both these series.[86]</p><br>
      <p>India unexpectedly crashed out of the World Cup after losses to Bangladesh<br> and 
       Sri Lanka in the group stage. Dhoni was out for a duck in both these matches <br>and 
       scored just 29 runs in the tournament. After the loss to Bangladesh in 2007 <br>Cricket
      World Cup, the house that Dhoni was constructing in his home-town Ranchi was <br>vandalised
      and damaged by political activists of JMM.[87] The local police arranged for <br>security
      for his family as India exited the World Cup in the first round.[88]</p><br>
